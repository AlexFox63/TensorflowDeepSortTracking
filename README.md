# Deep SORT with Tensorflow

## Introduction

This repository is an implementation to perform realtime tracking with Tensorflow using a [SSD model trained on the COCO dataset](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md). It is based on the *Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric* [Deep SORT](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) algorithm. See the original repository for more information.
